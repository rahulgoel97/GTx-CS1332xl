Doubly Linked Lists

############################

1. DLLs
2. CLLS

=== 1. DLLs ===
- Singly-Linked lists with addition of a previous reference
- Efficient remove from back

- AddToFront
-> create new node with data
-> Connect new node to the linked list
-> Set current head's previous pointer to the new node
-> Have head point to new node

=== 2. CLLs ===
-
- They are DLLs where the head and tail nodes connect to each other, rather than to null references
- Last node's next points to the head
- addToFront is O(n) process
-> for O(1) process, add a node as second node and then copy data over, then lastly replace the data in the first node is the "new" data

- Examples:
-- Web browser - singly linked lists
-- music app / caches - double linked lists
-- Music playlists starting over again - CLLs

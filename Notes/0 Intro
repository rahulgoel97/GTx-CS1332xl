VALUE REFERENCE EQUALITY WITH PRIMITIVES AND STRINGS

###############################

== 1. EQUALITY / REFERENCE == 

- reference equality - same object in memory. ie: using ==

- value equality - could be different places in memory, but the value is the same. ie: using .equals()

== 2. PRIMITIVES ==

- do not extend Object class like most types for optimizing compute
- no diff between reference and equality!

int one = 1;
int one2 = 1;

They both will be same using '=='

== 3. STRING LITERALS ==

 - Instead of creating new objects, Strinng creates literals / constants stored in the "String pool" - optimize speed

 - No diff in value / ref equality!

 - HOWEVER, if the new keyword is used a new String object is created - causing it to behave with reference / value equality. 
 - Then need to use .equals() to get correct equality evaluation

 =>RG note: Wicked - java is doing all this stuff for speed and memory


#############################

VALUE REFERENCE EQUALITY WITH OBJECTS

###############################

== 4. NULL CHECKING ==

- Use "==" otherwise NullPointerException aka NPE (by cool kids)

- If we use .equals() it's incorrect, use '==' to check for null

- .equals() uses String class's function and will throw NPE is we try to do

> String nullObject = null;
> nullObject.equals(null);  // !NullPointerException
> nullObject == null; // True - correct way...

== 5. WRAPPER OBJECTS == 

- Each primitive (eg: int, double, sring) has a wrapper Object class (eg: Integer, Double, String - all classe)

> Integer object = new Integer(1);
> Integer primitive = 1;

> primitive.equals(object); // True
> primitive == object; // False

- Takeaway: equals() can compare underlying value in memory, but == can be thrown off by objects. 

== 6. TYPICAL USE CASE ==

- Exampe of an electronic health record, with multiple objects representing patients

- If I want to retrieve all records with "Rahul Goel", I will use "==". ie: find all records where .name=="Rahul Goel"

- However, if I want to retrieve a unique patient, I will use .equals() referencing an object. (unless there's a unique ID)

- Takeaway: == is many, .equals() is one of a kind and unique.

== 7. PASS BY VALUE & REFERENCE ==

- Pass by value - copy value to a var in helper fun
- Pass by ref - pass the whole damn thing

- For primitives, just use return in the end..

> public static int helper(int x) {
	...
	return x;
}

- For objects, use Container such as.. OBJECTS are passed by reference.

> public static void main helper(Container x) {...}

== 8. GENERICS == 

- A placeholder for any type (int, float, etc)

For:

public class Container {
    private Object object;

    public void set(Object object) {
        this.object = object;
    }

    public Object get() {
        return object;
    }
}

- Can pass > c1.set("Hello") and then > String s = (String)c1.get(); 

- Can pass > c2.set("hello"); and then > Integer i = (Integer)c2.get() - but this ain't an integer bro, so we get ClassCastException which will occur at runtime!

- Generics using angle brackets can fix this...

For: 

// Note use of <>

public class Container<T> {
    private T t;

    public void set(T t) {
        this.t = t;
    }

    public T get() {
        return t;
    }
}

Use...

> Container<String> c1 = new Container<String>();
> c1.set("hello");
> string s = c1.get()

If we do...
> Integer i = (Integer)c2.get() 
We will see an error at compile time - preferred to runtime!!!

== 9. GENERICS SYNTAX ==

> class ArrayList<T> {...}


// T aka parameter, is capitalized


// Declaration is...

> ArrayList<Integer> listOne = new ArrayList<Integer>();

// Also..
> ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(); 


== 10. Generic Arrays ==
- Arrays that support generics
- Arrays store / check type at runtime and not compile time
- But generics check at compile time
- This causes some issues.


- Eg: This is how an array is made in Java

> String[] cars;
> int[] myNum = {...};

- So imagine an array of type T named backingArray

> T[] backingArray = new T[10]; // error

> T[] backingArray = (T[]) new Object[10]; // this works

- Create an array of Objects, which is then cast into type T

== 11. Other Cases ==

For...

> class HashMap<K, V> {...}

We instantiate by..

> HashMap<String, Integer> A = new HashMap<>(); // Dont forget angle brackets...

- Can nest different params...

> ArrayList<type> nodeList = new ArrayList<>(); // if type is type


> ArrayList<BSTNode<T>> nodeList = new ArrayList<>(); // if type is a BSTNode<T>

== 12. Exercises / Participation ==

a. Getter & Setter methods - Getter returns value. Setter takes param and gives it to variable.

b Constructor and Variables - Hard to say if the variable names will conflict.... Voting for not compile due to ambiguous 'width'

c. Constructor chaining - Not sure if I need to use this(s,s). Can basically set length and width private doubles to s, vote for that. Google says - this() can be used in same class, super() from base class... Changed to this(s,s) -> classic example of "constructor chaining" though other one may achieve same result.

d. Generics - Needs Object casted to T

e. Pass by value / reference - They certainly are "variables", which is omitted in third choice. Needs container for reference passing - go for 2  - this is pass by value.

f. Value / Reference Equality - if new is used, creates a new object in String Pool. so dog1 and dog2 same, dog3 and dog4 are distinct. .equals() will compare via value equality, but == will compare reference equality. 

RESULTS
a INCORRECT - count had to be private. Since var is not used outside...
b INCORRECT - length 50 but width 0 - since width is doubly used. Look into why this is zero.
c CORRECT
d CORRECT 
e INCORRECT - They are variables that contain references to the ArrayList object. So objects have references passing around..
f CORRECT

Score - 50%. 

Reflection:
1. If variable doesn't need to be passed outside, private var.
2. If there is variable name conflict, the program is compiled and runs - but the variable stays 0.
3. Objects are passed as references.
